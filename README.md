# Multi-Step React Form

This project demonstrates a multi-step form implementation in React.js using Bootstrap for styling and transitions. The form collects personal information and address details across three steps, validating user input at each step before allowing progression to the next.

## Features

- **Multi-Step Form**: Divided into three sequential steps to collect user information progressively.
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation ensures required fields are filled and data formats are correct.
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Form data is stored locally in the browser's `localStorage`, allowing users to resume where they left off even after refreshing the page.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Utilizes Bootstrap for responsive design, form styling, and transitions between steps.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript (ES6+)
